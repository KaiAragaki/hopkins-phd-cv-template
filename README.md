# About

This repository contains a [Typst](typst.app) template for the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine CV template for PhD candidates.

*This* template tries its best to conform to the guidelines provided in the template above, but cannot make any assurances. If you encounter an issues with this template, please feel free to open an issue or make a pull request.

Some things that are required for this template but NOT enforced:
- Items should be in reverse chronological order (newest on top) but this template does not enforce that
- Names should be in the format of 'lastname firstinitial', but due to names being so heterogeneous in their format across cultures, it would be foolish to think I could automate that. You must supply them as you wish to see them.

Some other notes:
- The PhD degree MUST be supplied as 'Ph.D. expected'.
